This is a knockoff of Kahoot. Ka is the Egyptian word for a person's spirit, or soul. And if you hear hoots at night, you also hear chirps at day. Originally named plain boring flaskprojc, it has been now renamed to SoulChirp.

This is a flask project for school. Install flask by doing `pip3 install flask` and run with `python3 main.py`. You can edit the questions in `lib/question.py`.

Big thanks to all of the people at w3schools and StackOverflow!
